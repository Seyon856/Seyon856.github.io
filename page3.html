  <p>Steph Curry was drafted seventh overall by the Golden State Warriors in 2009 and is widely known as one of the greatest shooters in NBA history. He has changed the way basketball is played with his amazing three-point shooting. Over his career he has won four NBA championships in 2015, 2017, 2018, and 2022, earned two MVP awards including the first unanimous MVP in 2016, and been selected to many All NBA and All Star teams. He holds the record for the most three-pointers made in NBA history, the most three-pointers in a single season with 402 in 2015â€“16, and the most consecutive games with a made three-pointer at 157 games. He was also part of the Golden State team that set the record for most wins in a regular season with 73 in 2016. Known for being consistent and efficient, he has averaged around 47 percent from the field, 43 percent from three, and 91 percent from the free throw line while becoming one of, if not the most influential players in basketball.</p>
