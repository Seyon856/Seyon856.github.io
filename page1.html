  <p> Stephen Wardell Curry was born on March 14, 1988 in Akron Ohio. His parents 
  are Dell Curry and Sonya Adams. He often moved around as his dad was a professional basketball player. His dad played for both the Charlotte Hornets and the Toronto Raptors. As a result, Steph grew up in Charlotte, often playing basketball with his younger brother Seth Curry. When his dad played for the Raptors, Steph moved there and played for the Queensway Christian College boys' basketball team. Here, his basketball skills started to show as he was able to lead them to an undefeated season. He also played for Toronto 5-0, which was a team that plays across Ontario in which he led the team to a championship against future NBA players including Kelly Olynyk. After his father retired, they moved back to Charlotte, where he enrolled at Charlotte Christian School. Here, he led his team to three state playoff appearances. After finishing high school, he wanted to play for the Virginia Tech Hokies because his dad had played there, but they only offered a spot as a walk-on as Steph Curry was very slender. He decided to attend Davidson College as a result who were interested in him since 10th grade. </p>
